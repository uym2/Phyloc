#To compile:
g++ -pipe -O2 -std=c++14 3DAln.cpp -o 3DAln -lm
#Example
./seqAlign.sh -i highrate3.fasta -o highrate3.aln -p 0.1
./seqAlign.sh -i lowrate3.fasta -o lowrate3.aln -p 0.01

#Note: 3DAln can only align 3 sequences. The input file must include exactly 3 sequences and must be in FASTA format
#Note: the program was "hard code" to read file "BLOSUM62" as its substitution matrix. Please don't remove that file.
